READ ME

I see you've been snooping through the files. Well, you might be wondering what that folder is. It contains all the old fonts. Until I manage to get a working 1.6.2 font thing, you'll be seeing the default.

Please note that I will push a update out with the files you need for the font when fixed.

Thanks for being patient and have a nice day!
